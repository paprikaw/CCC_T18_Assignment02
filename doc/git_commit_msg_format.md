Git commit messages should be clear, concise, and informative about the changes made in the commit. A widely recommended format for Git commit messages is as follows:

```
Copy code
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```
1. type: Represents the category of the commit. Common types include:
    feat: A new feature
    fix: A bug fix
    docs: Documentation changes
    style: Code formatting changes (whitespace, indentation, etc.)
    refactor: Code refactoring (no new features or bug fixes)
    test: Adding or updating tests
    chore: Maintenance tasks (e.g., updating dependencies)

2. scope: Specifies the part of the codebase affected by the commit (e.g., component or module name).

3. subject: A brief description of the changes made, written in imperative mood (e.g., "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature"). The subject line should not exceed 50 characters.

4. optional body: A more detailed explanation of the changes made, if necessary. This section should be wrapped at 72 characters per line and written in the present tense.

5. optional footer: Any additional notes, such as referencing related issues or pull requests (e.g., "Closes #123" or "Related to #456").

Here's an example of a well-formatted commit message:
```
Copy code
feat(authentication): Add password reset functionality

- Users can now request a password reset link
- Password reset link is sent to the user's email
- Link expires after 1 hour

Closes #42
Following this format helps ensure that your Git commit messages are easy to understand and provide useful context to your teammates or other developers working on the project.
