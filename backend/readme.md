1. `@app.route("/", defaults={"path": ""})` and `@app.route("/<path:path>")` are used to serve the React app's `index.html` file for any route requested by the user. React's Single Page Application (SPA) is responsible for handling these routes. `<path:path>` is a variable representing the requested path. `defaults={"path": ""}` indicates that when the user visits the root path (`/`), the default path is an empty string.

2. About the `data` folder in React: `npm run build` usually packages only the files directly used in the `src` folder. If your JSON files in the `data` folder are not directly referenced, they might not be included in the build folder. To fix this, move these JSON files to the `public` folder and reference them in your React components using `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` plus the filename. For example, if you move the JSON files to `public/data/myData.json`, you can access them in your React component using `fetch(process.env.PUBLIC_URL + "/data/myData.json")`. This way, these JSON files will be copied to the build folder.

3. About the connection between React and Flask: When you run the Flask server, it serves the static files in the React build folder. In this case, your React app will directly communicate with the Flask server, so you don't need to specify the backend IP and port in React. When making requests in your React components, just use relative paths. For example, if you previously used `http://localhost:5001/api/bar-data`, now use `/api/bar-data`. This way, the request will automatically be sent to the currently running Flask server.

If your data still loads on the page, it's likely that your browser cached your previous configuration. Try clearing your browser cache and refreshing the page to ensure your configuration is working correctly. If you still encounter issues, double-check your code to ensure the new configuration is being used properly.
